# slstatus
speedie's likely dead fork of slstatus

### Warning
It is likely that I will NOT maintain this fork anymore as I have switched to [xshbar](https://github.com/speedie-de/xshbar).
Use it at your own risk, feel free to report any issues but I may not fix them.

### Installation
- Install dev-vcs/git using your favorite package manager
- git clone <this-url>
- cd slstatus
- sudo make install
- If you're using my build of dwm, edit dwm-applications and .Xresources/recompile the source code
